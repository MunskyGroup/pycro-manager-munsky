### Bug report

<!--To help us understand and resolve your issue, please fill out the form to the best of your ability.-->
<!--feel free to delete the sections that do not apply.-->

<!--Before submitting a bug report, make sure you have 
    1) installed the latest version of pycromanager (pip install pycromanager --upgrade) 
    2) are using the latest nightly build of micro-manager
    -->

<!--Also, note that many times things that may appear to be bugs in pycro-manager are 
    actually coming from the micro-manager core or the device adapters for the hardware in use.
    If this is the case, you should instead open a bug in the main micro-manager repository 
    (https://github.com/micro-manager/micro-manager). To check this, try reproducing your 
    bug using the micro-manager demo configuration, which comes with every micro-manager installation
    and provides simulated "demo" hardware. If you can't reproduce your issue with the demo configuration, 
    it is likely unrelated to pycro-manager
    -->
