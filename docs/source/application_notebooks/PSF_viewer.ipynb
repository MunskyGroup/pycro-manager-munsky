    "Buttons to start and stop data acquisition are added to the `napari` window using the `magic-gui` package. In this example, the data displayed in `napari` is resliced to get a live PSF viewer. However, reslicing is only a small example for the data analysis possible using `napari`.  \n",

    "Since the amount of data that can be transferred between `micromanager` and `pycro-manager` is currently limited to 100 MB/s, it's important that no more data is transferred to ensure smooth execution of the software.  \n",

    "- chip-size cropped to the central 512x512 px.  \n",
