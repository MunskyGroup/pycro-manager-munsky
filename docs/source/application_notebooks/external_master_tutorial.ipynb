    "# Using an external master clock for hardware control of a stage-scanning high NA oblique plane microscope \n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorial provided by [qi2lab](https://www.shepherdlaboratory.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses Pycro-Manager to rapidly acquire terabyte-scale volumetric images using external hardware triggering of a stage scan optimized, high numerical aperture (NA) oblique plane microscope (OPM). The microscope that this notebook controls is described in detail in this [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.030569v2), under the *stage scan OPM* section in the methods.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This high NA OPM allows for versatile, high-resolution, and large field-of-view single molecule imaging. The main application is quantifying 3D spatial gene expression in millions of cells or large pieces of intact tissue using interative RNA-FISH (see examples [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22297-7) and [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43943-8)). Because the fluidics controller for the iterative labeling is also controlled via Python (code not provided here), using Pycro-Manager greatly simplifies controlling these complex experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial highlights the use of the `post_camera_hook_fn` and `post_hardware_hook_fn` functionality to allow an external controller to synchronize the microscope acquisition (external master). This is different from the standard hardware sequencing functionality in Pycro-Manager, where the acquisition engine sets up sequencable hardware and the camera serves as the master clock.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The tutorial also discusses how to structure the events and avoid timeouts to acquire >10 million of events per acquistion."

    "Briefly, the stage scan high NA OPM is built around a [bespoke tertiary objective](https://andrewgyork.github.io/high_na_single_objective_lightsheet/) designed by Alfred Millet-Sikking and Andrew York at Calico Labs. Stage scanning is performed by an ASI scan optimized XY stage, an ASI FTP Z stage, and an ASI Tiger controller with a programmable logic card. Excitation light is provided by a Coherent OBIS Laser Box. A custom Teensy based DAC synchronizes laser emission and a galvanometer mirror to the scan stage motion to eliminate motion blur. Emitted fluorescence is imaged by a Photometrics Prime BSI.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The ASI Tiger controller is the master clock in this experiment. The custom Teensy DAC is setup in a closed loop with the Photometrics camera. This controller is detailed in a previous [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00514-7) on adaptive light sheet microscopy.\n",
